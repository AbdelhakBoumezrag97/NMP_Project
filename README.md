# NMP Project
   The Network Management Platform is a Python application for network automation based on Netmiko Library, it is designed to address and facilitate the network management tasks, where we had to put the strategy and make the example for automated process.

## NMP Prototype and workflow
   we cover four common main aspects where automation makes sense, which are:  
* Configuration management and provisioning.
* Verification and testing. 
* Confirmation and backups.
* Continuous checking and reports generation.
   
   Thatâ€™s all pretty cover most of an administrator daily work, and they all about pushing and gathering specific information from devices CLI using SSH protocol.
